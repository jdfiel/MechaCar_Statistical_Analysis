# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

The vehicle_length, ground_clearance and intercept variables are likely to have provided a non-random amount variance to the mpg values in the data.

Since the coefficients are not zero, the slope cannot be zero.

This linear model does not predict mpg as as the statistical significance of the intercept indicates that there are other variables that need to be considered.
